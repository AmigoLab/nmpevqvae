# Neuromorphologicaly-preserving Volumetric data encoding using VQ-VAE
# !!! THIS IS A PORT IN PROGRESS FROM TENSORFLOW TO PYTORCH !!!
## To Do - x (in progress) - v (done)
[x] Profile code to find out why is so slow

[] Finish coding the testing and results extraction

[] Enable command line args  

[] Clean, comment and refractor the code

[] Write the how to use section and create a small notebook about it

[] Release pretrained Healthy & Pathological-Finetuned models
  
## How to use
